This project was created on my work computer therefore I just uploaded the files as security on the machine wouldn't allow me to push to github from the command line. 

A co worker told me she had to do this manually by checking the pdfs and then checking the excel file and noting any differences in account numbers, due to company security I cannot upload the files that I used to create this project. But I wrote this to help improve her productivity.
